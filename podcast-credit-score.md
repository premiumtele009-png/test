## [INTRO — 0:00–1:30]

**[Upbeat intro music fades in, then fades under voice]**

**HOST:**
Hey everyone, welcome back to the show — the podcast where we talk real money, real mistakes, and real wins.

I'm your host, and today I'm sharing something personal — something I was honestly embarrassed about for a long time.

My credit score used to be a **580**.

That's it. A 580. If you know anything about credit scores, you know that's the kind of number that gets you rejected for apartments, hit with sky-high interest rates, and looked at sideways when you're trying to buy a car.

But here's the thing — within about **8 months**, I raised it by over **100 points**. It went from 580 to 690, and eventually above 700.

Today I'm going to walk you through exactly what I did, step by step — no gimmicks, no "secret hacks," just real, practical moves that actually worked.

Let's get into it.

**[Music fades out]**

## [SEGMENT 1: Why My Score Was So Low — 1:30–4:00]

**HOST:**
Before I tell you what I did to fix my score, I want to be honest about why it was bad in the first place — because I think a lot of you will relate.

I had three main problems:

**Number one — late payments.**
I was in my mid-twenties, juggling bills, not paying attention. I missed a credit card payment. Then a medical bill went to collections. Those two things alone tanked my score.

**Number two — high credit utilization.**
I had one credit card with a $1,000 limit and I was keeping about an $800 balance on it most of the time. That's 80% utilization. The sweet spot? Under 30%. I didn't know that.

**Number three — I had very little credit history.**
I'd been avoiding credit cards because I thought having no debt meant I was being responsible. And in some ways it does — but a thin credit file also means the bureaus don't have much to judge you on, so your score stays low.

So that was my starting point: late payments, high utilization, and a thin file.

Sound familiar? If so, keep listening — because the fixes are more straightforward than you think.

## [SEGMENT 2: Step 1 — Pull Your Credit Report and Dispute Errors — 4:00–7:00]

**HOST:**
The first thing I did — and the first thing I'd tell anyone to do — is pull your credit reports.

You're entitled to a **free credit report** from each of the three major bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — once per year at AnnualCreditReport.com. That's the official, government-authorized site.

I pulled all three and went through them line by line.

And here's what surprised me — **I found errors.**

There was a collection account on my report that wasn't even mine. Someone with a similar name had a debt, and it had been incorrectly attached to my file. I had no idea.

So I filed a dispute — online, through the bureau's website — provided documentation showing it wasn't my debt, and within about 45 days, it was removed.

Just removing that one incorrect item gave my score a **noticeable bump** — around 15–20 points.

So before you do anything else, look at your report. You might find errors. It's more common than you'd think — studies have shown that around **1 in 5 Americans** has an error on at least one of their credit reports.

**The action step here:**
- Go to AnnualCreditReport.com
- Download all three reports
- Look for accounts you don't recognize, incorrect balances, or outdated negative items
- File disputes for anything inaccurate

## [SEGMENT 3: Step 2 — Attack Your Credit Utilization — 7:00–11:00]

**HOST:**
Okay, this one made the **biggest single impact** on my score.

Credit utilization is the second most important factor in your FICO score — right behind payment history. It accounts for about **30%** of your score.

Utilization is simply: how much of your available credit are you using?

Like I said, I was at 80% — terrible. My goal was to get under 30%, and ideally under 10%.

Here's how I did it:

**Move one: I paid down my balance aggressively.**
I cut expenses for two months — no eating out, no subscriptions I didn't need — and threw every extra dollar at that credit card balance. I got it from $800 down to about $150 on a $1,000 limit.

That alone moved me from 80% utilization to 15%. Huge.

**Move two: I asked for a credit limit increase.**
Once I had a few months of on-time payments, I called my credit card company and asked for a higher limit. They bumped it from $1,000 to $1,500. My $150 balance was now about 10% utilization. Even better.

Important note: when you ask for a credit limit increase, ask your issuer to do a **soft pull only**. A hard inquiry can temporarily ding your score by a few points. Many issuers will accommodate this request.

**Move three: I kept my balance low every month.**
This one is ongoing, not a one-time fix. I started paying off my card in full every month, or at least keeping it under $100 on a $1,500 limit — that's under 7%.

The scoring models look at your utilization at the time your statement closes, so even if you pay it off right after, a high balance can still hurt your score temporarily.

**The action step here:**
- Calculate your current utilization on each card
- If any card is above 30%, make it a priority to pay it down
- Consider requesting a credit limit increase
- Make it a habit to keep balances low before your statement date

## [SEGMENT 4: Step 3 — Never Miss a Payment Again — 11:00–13:30]

**HOST:**
Payment history is the **single biggest factor** in your credit score — it makes up about **35%** of your FICO score.

One late payment can drop your score by 50 to 100 points. And it stays on your report for **seven years**.

That was hard for me to accept — especially when I learned that the late payment I made years ago would be following me around for that long. But I couldn't change the past. I could only control the future.

So I did something simple: **I automated everything.**

Every bill I had — credit card, utilities, phone — I set up autopay for at least the minimum payment. That way, even if I forgot or was traveling, the payment would still go through.

Then I set up calendar reminders to review my accounts monthly so I could catch anything unusual.

Since I made that change, I haven't missed a single payment. And as those on-time payments stack up month after month, the older late payment has less and less weight on my score.

**The action step here:**
- Set up autopay on all your bills — at minimum the minimum payment
- For cards you pay in full, set a calendar reminder to review and pay before the due date
- If you have a late payment on your report, the best thing you can do is just move forward and build a clean track record

## [SEGMENT 5: Step 4 — Become an Authorized User — 13:30–16:00]

**HOST:**
This one is a bit of a secret weapon, and it worked really well for me.

I talked to my mom — who has excellent credit and has had credit cards since before I was born — and I asked if she'd add me as an **authorized user** on one of her oldest cards.

She said yes.

Here's why this works: when you're added as an authorized user, that card's entire history — including its age and payment record — can appear on YOUR credit report. You don't even have to use the card. You just get the benefit of the history.

My mom's card was 20 years old with a perfect payment history. Adding that to my report immediately boosted the average age of my accounts and added a long positive history.

Within about 60 days of being added, my score jumped another 20–25 points.

Now, a few things to note:

- You need someone who **trusts you** and has a card with a good history
- You don't need to have the physical card or use it
- If the primary cardholder misses a payment or maxes out the card, it can hurt your score — so choose someone responsible
- If you don't have a family member or friend who can do this, there are **credit rent-a-tradeline** services, but be careful — some are scammy, and this is a gray area

**The action step here:**
- Think about whether you have a trusted family member or friend with excellent credit who might add you as an authorized user
- Ask them clearly, explain why, and reassure them you won't use the card unless agreed upon

## [SEGMENT 6: Step 5 — Add Positive History With a Secured Card or Credit-Builder Loan — 16:00–19:00]

**HOST:**
If you have a thin credit file — meaning you don't have much credit history — one of the best things you can do is open a **secured credit card** or take out a **credit-builder loan**.

A secured card works like this: you put down a deposit — usually $200–$500 — and that deposit becomes your credit limit. You use the card for small purchases, pay it off every month, and the bank reports that positive activity to the credit bureaus.

After 6–12 months of on-time payments, many secured cards will upgrade you to a regular unsecured card and return your deposit.

I opened a secured card with a $300 deposit and used it to pay for gas and one subscription. I paid it off in full every month. After 9 months, the issuer upgraded me to a regular card.

That consistent positive history added weight to my credit file.

A **credit-builder loan** works differently — you make monthly payments into an account, and at the end of the loan term, you get the money. The whole point is that the on-time payments get reported to the bureaus. Banks and credit unions often offer these for $300–$1,000.

**The action step here:**
- If you have a thin credit file, consider opening one secured card and using it for small, regular purchases
- Pay it off in full every month — no exceptions
- Look into credit-builder loans through local credit unions or apps like Self

## [SEGMENT 7: Putting It All Together — The Timeline — 19:00–21:30]

**HOST:**
Let me give you a sense of how the timeline played out for me, because I know people want to know: how fast can this actually happen?

**Month 1:**
- Pulled my credit reports, found and disputed the error
- Started paying down my credit card balance aggressively
- Set up autopay on all bills

**Month 2:**
- Dispute resolved, incorrect account removed — score went from 580 to roughly 605
- Balance was down, utilization dropped significantly — score up another 10–15 points
- Applied for and opened a secured card

**Month 3–4:**
- Requested credit limit increase on my original card — approved
- Score around 635–640
- Consistent on-time payments stacking up

**Month 5:**
- Added as authorized user on my mom's card
- Score jumped to about 660–665

**Month 6–8:**
- Continued building positive history
- Kept utilization under 10%
- Score crossed 690, eventually hitting 705

Eight months. 125 points. No magic. Just consistent, strategic moves.

## [SEGMENT 8: What NOT to Do — 21:30–23:00]

**HOST:**
Before I wrap up, I want to quickly cover a few things I see people do that **hurt** their scores instead of helping:

**Don't close old accounts.**
The age of your credit history matters. Closing an old card actually shortens your credit history and can increase your utilization ratio. If you have an old card with no annual fee, just keep it open, even if you barely use it.

**Don't apply for a bunch of new credit at once.**
Each application triggers a hard inquiry, which temporarily drops your score a few points. Space out any new credit applications.

**Don't fall for "credit repair" companies that promise miracles.**
If a company promises to remove accurate negative items from your credit report for a large upfront fee — run. They cannot legally do anything you can't do yourself for free. Many of them are scams.

**Don't ignore collections.**
If you have accounts in collections, deal with them. You may be able to negotiate a **pay-for-delete** agreement — where you pay the debt and the collector removes the account from your report. Always get the agreement in writing before you pay.

## [OUTRO — 23:00–25:00]

**HOST:**
Alright, let's bring it home.

Here's the quick recap of the five steps that raised my credit score over 100 points:

1. **Pull your credit reports and dispute errors.** Don't skip this — errors are common and removing them is free.
2. **Lower your credit utilization below 30% — ideally below 10%.** This one move had the biggest single impact for me.
3. **Never miss a payment again.** Set up autopay. Make it automatic.
4. **Become an authorized user** on someone else's well-managed account.
5. **Build positive history** with a secured card or credit-builder loan if you have a thin file.

Credit repair is not about finding loopholes — it's about demonstrating, consistently, over time, that you are a reliable borrower. That's it.

It took me eight months. For some people it takes six months. For others it takes a year or two, depending on how much damage there is to overcome. But every single one of those steps is in your control.
